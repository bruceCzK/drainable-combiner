# drainable-combiner
A Project Zomboid mod that will combine all of a single selected drainable item in the players inventory on a single inventory click. Get away from having to combine each singular item.


## How
Right click on your drainable item, and click "Combine All". Your character will go through the process of combining the glue until it is as condensed as possible.

#### Note
This functionality only works for items with a `conConsolidate = true` according to Project Zomboid. Things like Car Batteries/etc will not present the option.
